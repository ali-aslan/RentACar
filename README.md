Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I started using the CQRS Pattern in our E-commerce and Microservices projects due to its advantages in high performance, scalability, testability, and different storage options. 
While researching if there were any gaps, I came across Mr. Engin DemiroÄŸ's 20-hour "C# .NET Core Clean Architecture & CQRS Project Infrastructure" course, which caught my attention, and I recently completed the training.

Although the course content is comprehensive overall, notable points include:

ðŸ§© Clean Architecture Implementation:

* DDD-focused Clean Architecture
* SOLID and Clean Code Techniques
* Synchronous and Asynchronous Repository Implementations
* Dynamic Search Implementation
* Mapping focused on Response Request Pattern with Automapper
  
ðŸ”„ CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):

* Advanced Entity Framework Implementations
* API Implementations
* Extension Writing Techniques

ðŸ“š Related Domain Modeling:

* Advanced Mapping
* Migration Implementation
* Business Rule and Clean Code Writing Techniques
* Global Error Handling
* Fluent Validation Implementation with Pipeline and Validation Pipeline
* Transactional Operation Implementation with Transaction Pipeline

ðŸš€ Cache and Logging:

* Caching Pipeline
* InMemory and Redis Cache Implementations
* Logging Pipeline and Serilog Implementation

ðŸ”’ Security and Test-Oriented Development:

* Security and JWT Implementation
* Mailing Implementation
* Test-oriented infrastructure development and Moq Implementation

Additionally, through "nArchitecture.Gen," you can quickly generate your custom structure automatically. I recommend anyone with gaps in these areas to benefit from this training.
